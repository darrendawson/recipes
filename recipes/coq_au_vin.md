  5. Lay chicken on top of vegetables in cast iron.
  6. Pour 2 cups of wine over the top of chicken, it will collect in the cast iron.

#### Cooking the chicken
  1. Use conveggtor tool to set egg to indirect heat.
  2. Add wood chips to charcoal for extra smoke.
  3. Place cast iron pan with vegetables directly on top of conveggtor (underneath the grate)
  4. Place chicken on grate above the cast iron such that any drippings will fall into it.
  5. Smoke the chicken at low heat (200-250) for 40 minutes.
  6. Take the chicken and vegetables out of the grill. Stir the vegetables and place the chicken on top of them.
  7. Reconfigure the BGE to be a direct heat setup by removing the conveggtor.
  8. Place the cast iron on top of the grate with vegetables and chicken.
  9. Cook until the chicken breast registers 165. Baste the chicken with the wine sauce every 5-10 minutes.

#### Prepping the sauce
  1. Remove chicken from pan and strain out vegetables to get the wine sauce. Place chicken in oven on lowest temp to keep warm while we make the sauce.
  2. Mince the other half of the garlic.
  3. In a saucepan and low heat, cook garlic in butter until they start to golden.
  4. Increase temperature to medium / medium-high and add wine sauce from chicken, an additional 1/2 cup of wine, onion juice, beef broth, creme, italian seasoning, thyme, and oregano. Stir regularly for about 10 minutes.

## 4) Notes

Notes
  - The sauce was really good, didn't taste too winey
  - The chicken was cooked well, the smoking doesn't dry it out
  - Serving with dinner rolls was good


Next Time:
  - Use more onions! minced onions in the sauce may be really good.
  - Maybe add the beef broth with the wine from the get go so the vegetables can cook in them.
