# Fried Chicken Sandwich

## 1) About / Inspiration

This fried chicken sandwich is based on the [recipe for the Chick'n Shack](https://www.thebacklabel.com/recipe/chickn-shack/) - Shake Shack's fried chicken sandwich. Instead of going with their buttermilk herb mayo, however, we decided to make a chipotle mayo instead.

## 3) Instructions

#### Marinading the Chicken
  1. Slice shallot thinly.
  2. Dice garlic and jalapeno.
  3. Combine all marinade ingredients into a 1 gallon bag.
  4. Add chicken to marinade and let rest in the fridge.
      - Should be at least an hour and "up to overnight"
      - We did 5 hours

#### Dredging the Chicken
  1. Combine all seasoned flour ingredients in a large bowl.
  2. Pour flour over wide rimmed baking sheet.
  3. Remove chicken from the marinade and pour marinade into a large bowl.
  4. For each chicken:
      1. Dredge chicken in flour, covering well.
      2. Shake off excess flour and submerge in marinade bowl.
      3. Dredge the chicken again.
      4. Place on another baking sheet to await frying process.


#### Making the Mayo
  1. Combine mayo and ketchup in a medium sized bowl.
  2. In a small bowl, add all dry spices.
  3. Add jalapeno juice to spices and combine.
  4. Stir the spice liquid into the mayo+ketchup mixture.
  5. Add flour until the mayo reaches your preferred level of thickness.
  6. Store in fridge until needed.


#### Frying the Chicken
  1. Pour oil into a cold pot and setup candy thermometer.
  2. Heat on high until oil reaches 325-350 degrees.
      - We'll want to keep it in this temperature range while cooking.
      - Make adjustments as needed.
      - If the oil is too cold, the breading won't stay on the chicken.
  3. Add chicken 2 thighs at a time and cook for around 5 minutes.
      - They should come out "deep golden brown and crisped"
  4. After taking the chicken off the heat, let rest on paper towels to drain excess oil.

#### Making the Sandwich
  1. Toast the buns in butter on the stove.
  2. Separate head of lettuce and wash.
  3. Slice pickles into desired shape for sandwich (we emulated rounds).
  4. Make the sandwich.
      1. Add mayo to both sides of buns.
      2. Add lettuce and pickles to bottom bun.
      3. Add fried chicken.


## 4) Notes

Notes
  - Was very tasty, although we found that the amount of mayo required to properly sauce the sandwich meant that the flavors of the chicken marinade were completely drowned out.
      - This made the sandwich feel pretty one note
      - Would be nice to have some kind of other sauce to compliment the chipotle mayo.
      - The other sauce could maybe be the buttermilk herb mayo? Or possibly a Ranch style sauce?
      - If the other sauce was available as a dip I think it would be optimal, because you would add it while eating instead of trying to find a good balance while making the sandwich.  
  - Tomato may have been a good addition, not in terms of flavor but in terms of texture.
  - Chicken thighs are an awkward shape, meaning some bites will have a lot of chicken and some will have not as much.
      - The Chick'n Shack uses breast, but I tend to prefer thigh over breast.
