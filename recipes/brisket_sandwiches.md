# Brisket Sandwiches

## 1) About / Inspiration

This recipe is for "Gaucho" style brisket sandwiches - smoked brisket, chimichurri sauce, and mozzarella cheese on chewy bread.

This sandwich's inspiration came from the following sources:
  1. My friend Collin and I made this recipe but with tri-tip instead of brisket and it was *very good*
  2. Mission Street Barbecue in Santa Cruz offers a Guacho sandwich that is good but doesn't live up to its own potential.

For this actual recipe, I followed [Steamy Kitchen's Chimichurri Sauce guide](https://steamykitchen.com/15405-skirt-steak-with-chimichurri-sauce.html) and looked at [this Big Green Egg brisket recipe](https://biggreenegg.com/recipes/smoked-brisket/), although my recipe for the brisket was substantially different.

## 3) Instructions

#### Brisket
  1. Combine all powders / dry ingredients in the brisket rub.
  2. Liberally cover the brisket with the rub (you can't put too much rub).
  3. Leave the brisket out of the fridge for ~1 hour before starting the grill.
  4. Set up your smoker for indirect heat at 250-275 degrees Fahrenheit, making sure to soak the woodchips 15 minutes before using.
  5. Place the Brisket in the smoker fat cap up and cook until internal temperature at highest point reaches 205 degrees Fahrenheit.  
    - Make sure the temperature of the smoker remains under 275.
    - The rising internal temperature of the meat will stall around 165-170. This is normal.
    - In order to create the Brisket's signature bark, do not cover the meat with aluminum foil during the cooking process.
    - Do not flip the meat at any point. The fat cap should remain on top because it "melts" down into the meat.
  6. When the brisket has reached its target temperature, you can verify that it is cooked properly by doing some weirdo bullshit I found online:
    - Drop the brisket from 3 inches onto a cutting board. If it jiggles instead of bouncing, it is done.
    - Use a fork to twist through the meat. If there's very little resistance, it is done.
  7. After taking the brisket off of the heat, wrap it in aluminum foil and pour the chicken/beef broth into the foil, sealing tightly. Keep this wrapped up for 1 hour.
    - This broth will infuse with the brisket, making the brisket juicer and creating a delicious sauce at the bottom of the foil.

#### Chimichurri Sauce
  1. Dice up the oregano, parsley and mince the garlic.
  2. Mix oil, vinegar, and the oregano, parsley, garlic in a bowl. Add red pepper flakes.
    - This should come out like a liquidy paste.
    - Mix in the oil last so you can fine tune how liquidy/oily you want it to actually be.
  3. Salt as needed.


#### Sandwiches
  1. Grate cheese.
  2. Slice tomatoes for sandwiches.
  3. Slice brisket for sandwiches - thick but not too thick.  
  4. Cut bread into slices for sandwiches.
  5. Spread Asian Mayo on each side of bread.
  6. Put brisket on bottom piece of bread and add cheese on top.
  7. Broil bottom piece of bread until cheese is melted.
  8. Add chimichurri and tomatoes and complete sandwich.

## 4) Notes

Notes:
  - The brisket was delicious, well cooked, and super beefy. There was a consensus between the brothers that the brisket was better than my tri-tip and in the same ballpark as the ribs.
  - The sandwiches were excellent and the chimichurri + brisket worked really well.
  - The rub recipe makes more than is needed for the brisket. This can be saved and used as a base for tri-tip or rib rubs later and is very close to burger seasoning.
  - Tomato was a non-essential but still very important ingredient for the sandwich.


For Next Time:
  - The rub could have used a little more kick. It shouldn't be spicy like the rib rubs, but some chipotle powder and cayenne would have been appreciated.
  - The sandwiches were over-oily because of the mix of meat and chimichurri sauce together. This caused the bottom piece of bread to be soggy, which was unideal. Therefore, the chimichurri sauce would be better with less oil.
  - The broth added to the brisket during resting was delicious. Do more of that!
  - While good, the mozzarella by itself was not quite as interesting as it could have been. Adding jack or a blend of other cheeses to the mozzarella would make it better.
  - The bread being chewy was good, but the particular Ciabatta we got was almost too chewy and hurt my jaw.


## 5) Alternative Recipe Idea: Cafe style

Essentially the same ingredients as the Gaucho sandwich proper, except open faced and with the bread cut into long, thin strips. This makes eating the sandwich a little easier, both in terms of chew time and ease of fitting in your mouth.
