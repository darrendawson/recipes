# Spaghetti

## 1) About/Inspiration
This is a recipe I would cook at my apartment in college - it's (relatively) cheap, it's tasty, and it has leftovers (when you're only cooking for yourself). I made this for my brothers (4 people total), so doubled the recipe.

## 2) Ingredients and Hardware

#### Ingredients
  - 2 boxes of Barilla spaghetti
  - 3 cup container of pasta sauce
      - Any sauce works, this time I used a Creamy tomato basil pasta sauce from Trader Joes
      - If you can get a 4 cup container, that would actually be better.
  - 1 Onion
  - 1 head garlic
  - 1 jalapeno
  - 15 pepperocini
  - 1 bell pepper
  - 20-30 salami slices (the pre-cut circles)
  - 1 cup red wine
  - 0.2 cup heavy cream
  - 1 tablespoon cooking oil
      - We used grapeseed
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - 0.5 teaspoon chile powder
  - 0.5 teaspoon chipotle powder
  - 1 teaspoon paprika
  - 1 teaspoon garlic powder
  - 1 teaspoon onion powder
  - shredded cheese
  - salt
  - black pepper

#### Hardware
  - tall pot to cook spaghetti in
  - large pan with high walls for sauce (preferably 2 of these)

## 3) Instructions

#### Prep
  1. Dice the onion. Set aside 1/4 of it for garnish.
  2. Dice the garlic.
  3. Cut bell pepper into small square shaped pieces.
  4. Dice the jalapeno and pepperocini
  5. Cut the salami into pieces, roughly the same size as the bell pepper.

#### Cooking the Noodles
  1. Break uncooked noodles in half so they are a more manageable length after cooking.
  2. Bring a 1/2 full pot of water to a boil.
  2. Add 3 generous pinches of salt to water.
  3. Add olive oil to water (this should prevent noodles from sticking).
  4. Add noodles to water and cook for 12 minutes, stirring occasionally.

#### Cooking the Sauce
Stove space sparing, this part can be started at the same time as cooking the noodles.
  1. Coat bottom of pan with oil and bring up to medium heat.
  2. Add onion and garlic to oil. Apply salt and pepper and let cook for ~7 minutes, stirring often enough to prevent burning.
  3. Add jalapeno, pepperocini, and bell pepper to pan and stir in the dry spices (chile powder, chipotle powder, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder). Let cook for another 7 minutes, stirring frequently.
  4. Add salami to pan. After 3 minutes, pour enough red wine to soak into the vegetables but not enough to pool. Cook for another 5 minutes.
  5. Pour pasta sauce, cream, and red wine into pan and stir. Let stew for another 5-10 minutes, stopping when the sauce starts to thicken up.
      - The actual amounts of cream and red wine should be done to taste.
  6. Fold the noodles into the sauce in the pan over low heat.
      - The amount of noodles is up to you, but make sure you don't add too many noodles for the amount of sauce actually made (that will be sad for everyone involved).
      - In our case, we used maybe 2/3 of the noodles for the sauce and had 1/3 of the noodles left over.
  7. Mix cheese into noodles and sauce, turning off the heat when the cheese is melted and fully incorporated. The amount of cheese is to taste.
  8. Add the leftover onions as garnish and serve.


## 4) Notes

Notes:
  - Got a fist bump from my little brother, which is typically a good sign. Was very tasty.
  - I didn't get the right ratio of sauce to noodles, so there were noodles left over that were eaten with salt/pepper and butter (still tasty).
      - Get more sauce! This means start off with more than 1 3-cup container's worth of off the shelf pasta sauce.
  - The cheese wasn't as good as it could have been:
      - Pure mozzarella slices would have been *really* good melted onto the noodles.
      - Given our mild sauce shortage, some sort of cheese roux (butter, cream, gruyere) would have gone very nicely.
  - The spice level was flavorful without being spicy.
      - At the level it was, it was definitely tasty.
      - People were undecided whether it should have had more spice or if it should have had less.
      - Maybe add more jalapeno (added later so its cooked less) and then lower the dry spice levels.
  - Out of options for meat, people think tri-tip would be a good go-to.
      - We think that we'd rather replace salami with other meat (rather than adding on top of salami)
      - I've cooked this with bacon and it was pretty good.
  - Would be good with garlic bread (duh).
