# Cold Tritip Sandwiches

## 1) About/Inspiration
This recipe is for a tritip sandwich where the meat is served cold. This was necessary because we needed a meal that was well suited for the 104 degree heat wave we were experiencing.

The idea for the sandwich was inspired by Gayle's tritip sandwiches in Capitola.


## 2) Ingredients

#### Tritip
The amounts for the rub are pretty 'play it by ear'.
  - 1 cut tritip (~2.5 lb, but more is generally better)
  - 3 tablespoons salt
  - 2 teaspoons black pepper
  - 1/4 cup brown sugar
  - 3 tablespoons garlic powder
  - 3 tablespoons onion powder
  - 1 tablespoon chipotle powder
  - 1 teaspoon cayenne powder
  - 1 tablespoon chili powder
  - 2 tablespoon paprika
  - 3/4 cup chicken stock

#### Sandwich Materials
  - 6 french rolls
  - butter
  - 1 onion (preferably red)
  - 1 tomato (large)

#### Tritip Aioli
Note: tweak the amounts listed here to fit your needs. Generally the more mayo/ketchup, the firmer the aioli will be (which is desirable).
  - 1/4 cup chicken stock (this is included in the 3/4 for the tritip)
  - 1/2 cup asian mayo
  - 1/8 cup ketchup (we used 1/4 cup which came off as overly sweet)
  - wasabi to taste


#### Hardware
  - aluminum foil
  - plastic wrap
  - charcoal grill

## 3) Instructions

#### Tritip
  1. Prepare the rub my mixing all the dry ingredients.
  2. Generously coat the rub onto the tritip (you can't put too much).
  3. Cover with plastic wrap and leave the tritip in the fridge for at least an hour.
  4. Take the tritip out and cook on a charcoal grill in the 300-350 degree range until internals register 125 degrees. This took ~45 minutes for us.
  5. Taking the tritip off the grill, wrap in aluminum foil and pour chicken stock into the foil.
    - This should be tight enough that the chicken stock doesn't leak out of the foil.
  6. Place the wrapped tritip in the fridge for 2 hours to rest and cool off.
  7. Unwrap the tritip and slice thinly.
  8. Place the meat back into the chicken stock it was resting in and fridge until ready to eat.
  9. Optionally, move the tritip into the freezer 30 minutes before eating so that it'll get even cooler.


#### Tritip Aioli
  1. Siphon off 1/4 cup from the stock the tritip is resting in (save the rest for later).
    - the later in the process you siphon the stock off, the better it will taste.
  2. Mix asian mayo and ketchup into stock. Add more asian mayo if its too liquidy.
  3. Add wasabi to taste.
    - It should have kick but not be too overpowering, since the aioli will be used liberally on the sandwiches.


#### Sandwiches
  1. Thinly slice onions and tomatos.
  2. Fry the bread in butter on the stove.
  3. Spread aioli over bottom piece of bread.
  4. Stack tritip on bottom piece of bread, with a rule of thumb being "the more the merrier".
  5. Spread more aioli over top the tritip.
  6. Add onion + tomato.
  7. Heat up the rest of the stock that wasn't used in the aioli.
  8. Serve the sandwiches with the leftover aioli and the stock as optional dips.


## 4) Notes

Notes:
  - While this sandwich turned out reasonable, it wasn't fantastic. Therefore, these notes below are important for understanding how to improve it.
  - Cooking the tritip in the morning and then fridging/freezing it during the day works well. Unfortunately, this technique means that any char from the grill will be lost in the final product.
  - The cold temperature of the meat worked well, even with the bread being warmed.
  - On our first round of sandwiches, it felt like it was missing some form of tang. Adding mustard helped some but wasn't quite right. For the second round, we added wasabi to the aioli and that helped a lot.
  - Overall, the sandwich felt too samey - we attribute it to most of the flavors being sweet.
    - tritip has brown sugar, but that is essential
    - aioli has ketchup, which is less essential when wasabi is added.
    - the onions we used were yellow onions, which are sweet.
  - We actually made grilled onions too, but the flavors didn't contribute to the sandwich and were mostly overshadowed.

For Next Time:
  - Get better bread. The french rolls we got from Safeway detracted from the sandwich.
  - Get a larger cut of tritip (> 3lb) so that each sandwich can have an optimal amount of meat.
  - Add wasabi to the sandwich! It's much better that way.
  - Use less ketchup to lower sweetness.
  - Use red onions instead of yellow onions to lower sweetness and increase onion flavor.
  - No need to grill onions.
