# Ribeye

## 1) About/Inspiration

This recipe is for a pretty classic steak, reverse seared on a charcoal grill.

## 2) Ingredients and Hardware

#### Steak
  - 2.5 lb of (preferably dry aged) ribeye, cut into 2 2-inch pieces.
  - 2 tablespoons salt
  - 1/2 tablespoon black pepper
  - 1 tablespoon onion powder
  - 1 tablespoon garlic powder
  - 3 teaspoons white sugar
  - Olive oil
  - Ghee (or unsalted butter)

#### Hardware
  - Big Green Egg or other grill

## 3) Instructions

#### Prep
  1. Combine all dry ingredients for rub
  2. Pour just enough olive oil on the steak to moisten, then generously spread rub over the steak.
    - If the cut of steak is at least 1.5 inches, you can't put too much of the rub on here.
  3. Let steak sit on an elevated wire rack for 1 hour.


#### Cooking
  1. Cook on grill at low temperature (in 250-275 range) until internal reaches 120-125 range.
    - This took about 40 minutes.
    - Flip roughly every 10 minutes to ensure even cooking.
  2. Take steak off heat and raise temperature of grill to 400 (or high enough that flames touch grill top).
  3. Sear steak in flame for 2 minutes, flipping it over every 30 seconds to make sure crisping is even and not too much.
  4. Take steak off grill for good and spread ghee on top of it.
  5. As the ghee melts, spoon it back over the steak and let rest for 5 minutes.


## 4) Notes

  - Steak was very successful and considered top-tier steak house worthy (ie: Hawksmoore or Alexander's).
  - The only recommendation for possible improvements (other than getting wagyu) was that it could have been more charred, although that is understood to not be super typical in steak house type steaks because of the butter bath.
  - The seasoning was good and didn't get in the way of the meat. Right amount of salt. The extras (garlic powder, onion powder, and sugar) were welcome additions to the standard salt/pepper affair of classic steak.
  - Good amount for 3-4 people (assuming it's accompanied by incidentals)

For next time:
  - Try doing the ghee basting step in between the stages of the reverse sear. This may allow the sear to stay crispy, although it also may result in the butter being burnt off.
  - Try using garlic butter and/or italian seasonings for the butter basting. This may allow some subtle flavors to introduce themselves and add some depth.
    - When prompted, people seemed to think this wasn't super necessary, but I think it could be interesting.
